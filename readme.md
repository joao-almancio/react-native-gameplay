# Gameplay
Simple React app created with Expo using some of the functionalities from Discord.

## With this App you can:
- [x] Login using your Discord account with Auth2.
- [x] View all guilds you are in.
- [x] View the members (avatar, status and username) and the status of the guilds (once the widget server's functionality is activated).
- [x] Send an instant link to access your server or send the invitation.
- [x] Create appointments (stored localy) for a server.
- [x] Filter your appointments.
- [x] Logout.

## Future Implementations
- [ ] Logout modal.
- [ ] Delete appointments functionality.
- [ ] Filter system experience improvement.
- [ ] Form validation.
- [ ] User's Profile View.
- [ ] View other people's profile.


## Considerations
- The app is in Portuguese (Brazil)
- It was part of a intensive week of hands-on experience promoted by [Rocketseat](https://blog.rocketseat.com.b) from June 21st to June 27th.
- Updates and new features after June 25th are of my own and product of what I learned within this week promoted by Rocketseat and from my learning experience.
- Feel free to use, modify and let's learn together.
